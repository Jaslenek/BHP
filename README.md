# BHP
End-to-end Machine Learning project predicting Bangalore home prices. Built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn with a full workflow — from data cleaning and model training to web app deployment.

This project is my first end-to-end Machine Learning application, built to predict home prices in Bangalore based on features such as location, area (sqft), BHK, and number of bathrooms.
It demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to web deployment using Flask and a simple interactive interface.
