# BHP
End-to-end Machine Learning project predicting Bangalore home prices. Built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn with a full workflow — from data cleaning and model training to web app deployment.

This project is my first end-to-end Machine Learning application, built to predict home prices in Bangalore based on features such as location, area (sqft), BHK, and number of bathrooms.
It demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to web deployment using Flask and a simple interactive interface.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Backend: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Tools: Pickle, JSON

🧠 Workflow
Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed housing dataset.
Model Building: Trained a regression model using Scikit-learn.
Integration: Exposed predictions through a Flask API.
Deployment: Linked backend with a web interface for real-time predictions.
